# Design and Evaluation of Novel Algorithms to Enhance Group Fairness in Federated Learning under Non-IID Data

This project explores the design and implementation of novel algorithms to improve group fairness in Federated Learning systems, especially in the presence of non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data. The research evaluates fairness-aware methods addressing biases introduced due to imbalanced or skewed data distributions across different client devices, with a focus on ensuring equitable outcomes for different demographic groups.

The work includes both algorithmic development and empirical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in real-world scenarios.
